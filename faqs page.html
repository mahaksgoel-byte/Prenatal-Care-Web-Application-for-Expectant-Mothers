                    question: "How often should I track my weight during pregnancy?",
                    answer: "It's recommended to track your weight at each prenatal appointment, typically every 4 weeks until 28 weeks, then every 2 weeks until 36 weeks, and weekly thereafter. Avoid daily weighing as normal weight fluctuations may cause unnecessary concern."
                },
                {
                    question: "How can I track my baby's movements?",
                    answer: "Start counting kicks around week 28. Choose a time when your baby is usually active and count movements. You should feel at least 10 movements within 2 hours. Use our app's kick counter feature for easy tracking."
                },
                {
                    question: "How often should I log my symptoms?",
                    answer: "It's recommended to log significant symptoms daily, especially new ones or changes in existing symptoms. This helps identify patterns and provides valuable information for your healthcare provider."
                },
                {
                    question: "How accurate are the pregnancy week calculations?",
                    answer: "Our pregnancy week calculations are based on your last menstrual period or ultrasound dating. While generally accurate, always defer to your healthcare provider's official dating of your pregnancy."
                },
                {
                    question: "What is considered normal blood pressure during pregnancy?",
                    answer: "Normal blood pressure during pregnancy is typically around 120/80 mmHg. A reading above 140/90 mmHg may indicate pregnancy-induced hypertension and should be reported to your healthcare provider immediately."
                },
                {
                    question: "How often should I check my blood sugar if I have gestational diabetes?",
                    answer: "With gestational diabetes, you should typically check your blood sugar first thing in the morning (fasting) and 1-2 hours after the start of each meal. Your healthcare provider may recommend a different schedule based on your specific situation."
                },
                {
                    question: "What pregnancy symptoms warrant immediate medical attention?",
                    answer: "Seek immediate medical care for: severe abdominal pain, heavy vaginal bleeding, severe headaches with vision changes, decreased fetal movement, sudden swelling of face/hands, fever over 100.4Â°F, and contractions before 37 weeks."
                },
                {
                    question: "When should I start monitoring contractions?",
                    answer: "Start monitoring contractions when they become regular and increasingly painful. Use the app's contraction timer in the third trimester to track frequency (how often they occur), duration (how long each lasts), and intensity."

                    question: "How much water should I drink daily?",
                    answer: "During pregnancy, you should aim to drink 8-12 cups (64-96 ounces) of water daily. This helps maintain amniotic fluid levels, supports blood volume expansion, and prevents dehydration and constipation."
                },
                {
                    question: "What nutrients are most important during pregnancy?",
                    answer: "Key nutrients include folic acid, iron, calcium, vitamin D, DHA, and protein. A balanced diet supplemented with prenatal vitamins will help ensure you're getting adequate amounts of these essential nutrients."

                {
                    question: "Which foods should I avoid during pregnancy?",
                    answer: "Avoid raw or undercooked meat, fish with high mercury levels, unpasteurized dairy, raw eggs, certain soft cheeses, unwashed produce, and excessive caffeine. These foods pose risks of bacterial contamination or other harmful effects."
                },
                {
                    question: "How much extra calories do I need during pregnancy?",
                    answer: "During the first trimester, you generally don't need extra calories. In the second trimester, add about 340 extra calories daily, and in the third trimester, about 450 extra calories daily. Focus on nutrient-dense foods rather than empty calories."

                    question: "Are cravings normal during pregnancy?",
                    answer: "Yes, food cravings are normal during pregnancy due to hormonal changes, nutritional needs, and enhanced sense of smell. As long as you're maintaining a balanced diet overall, it's okay to indulge occasionally in safe cravings."

                {
                    question: "How can I manage morning sickness through diet?",
                    answer: "Eat small, frequent meals to keep your stomach from being empty, choose bland, easy-to-digest foods, stay hydrated, try ginger tea or candies, avoid triggering smells/foods, and eat protein-rich snacks before bed and first thing in the morning."
                },

                    question: "Is it safe to consume artificial sweeteners while pregnant?",
                    answer: "FDA-approved sweeteners like aspartame, sucralose, and stevia are generally considered safe in moderation during pregnancy. However, it's best to limit processed foods containing artificial ingredients and focus on natural, whole foods."

                    answer: "Kegel exercises help strengthen pelvic floor muscles. Contract the muscles you use to stop urination for 5-10 seconds, then release. Repeat 10-15 times, 3 times daily. Our app's exercise section includes guided pelvic floor workouts."
